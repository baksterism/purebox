            <br><br>
            <small>Use this form to suggest free and useful (or useless) resources! Submit as many as you'd like. I will give you credit for finding as these sources do not have to be made or hosted by you - just discovered!</small>
            <br><br>
            <small>Â» Have a website but it doesn't really fit into any of the resource categories? Well submit your website/page/git/etc. and I'll put it on a seperate page (here) so that others can discover it!</small></p>
